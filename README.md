    Basic input validation.
    1. Created a src folder
    2. created a components folder
    3. inside that a folder called Auth is made.
    4. created a LoginPage and SignUpPage

   2. Backend Setup
    Tech Stack: Express, Nodemon, CORS, Mongoose.

This milestone showcases the setup of a Login Page for my full-stack application. I’ve built the frontend using React and TailwindCSS for responsive UI and added a backend powered by Express, Nodemon, CORS, and Mongoose for managing the server and database.

## Features

### Frontend

1.	Responsive Login Form:
	- I’ve created a login form that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using TailwindCSS. This ensures a user-friendly experience across devices.
2.	Basic Input Validation:
	- I added input validation to the email and password fields to make sure users cannot submit empty values or invalid data.

## Frontend Directory Structure

### I organized the frontend project to keep the codebase modular and easy to maintain.
1.	Created a src folder:
	- This folder serves as the root for all application logic and UI components.
2.	Created a components folder:
	- Inside src, I added a components folder to store reusable UI elements for better organization.
3.	Created an Auth folder inside components:
	- The Auth folder houses authentication-related components.
4.	Built LoginPage and SignUpPage components:
	- These components handle the user login and registration forms respectively.

### Frontend Setup
1.	I’ve used cd frontend to navigate into the frontend directory.
2.	I’ve used npm install to install all the necessary dependencies for the frontend, like React and TailwindCSS.
3.	I’ve used npm start to launch the React development server and open the application in my browser.

### Backend Setup

1.	I’ve used cd backend to navigate into the backend directory.
2.	I’ve used npm install to install backend dependencies like Express, Nodemon, CORS, and Mongoose.
3.	I’ve used npm run dev to start the backend server in development mode with automatic restarts using Nodemon.
